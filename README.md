# Conway's Game of Life

This is a starting point for implementing Conway's game of life using Angular.

The skeleton components are provded, along with a game runner that uses a 300ms timer to trigger an update progress the game.

## TODO:

Be sure to have the typical Angular dependencies.  After cloning this repo, perform an `npm install` in the local workspace.

- Review game.service.spec.ts and game.service.ts.  This is where you will either create or call the game code that you will test-drive.
- Review gameRunner.component.spec.ts and gameRunner.component.ts.  With a few modifications, this is where you will initialize and display the game.  The code to progress the game every 300ms is provided here. 

## Game of Life Rules:

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 

It is acceptable to require the game to be played in a sized grid, rather than a potentially infinite grid.

At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

## Angular Info
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.2.
### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
